    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Eggs – we use large eggs, right out of the refrigerator</li>
        <li>Salt – just a pinch is plenty. We use fine sea salt which dissolves quickly.</li>
        <li>Butter – you want to keep a well-buttered skillet for each omelette. Butter adds flavor and keeps the omelette from sticking.</li>
        <li>Cheese – we love shredded mozzarella cheese (low moisture, part-skim), but you can use cheddar or your favorite cheese.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs – in a small bowl, combine 2 eggs and a pinch of salt then beat with a fork until frothy.</li>
        <li>Heat skillet – place a small non-stick pan over medium heat and melt in 1/2 Tbsp of butter. Once butter is melted and bubbly, add beaten eggs and reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Pull cooked eggs with a spatula into the center, allowing the liquid eggs to fill in the space. Watch the video tutorial above to see this process in action.</li>
